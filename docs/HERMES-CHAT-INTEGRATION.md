# Hermes Chat Integration — Design

> **Status:** Design (approved to build the full inbound agent — 2026-07-21).
> **Revises:** [ADR-017](DECISIONS.md) — which described "Hermes" as a WhatsApp *send* REST
> API. That mental model is wrong (see §1). The `MessagingGateway` **port** survives; the
> `HermesWhatsAppGateway` **adapter** is repurposed.
> **Owner artifacts:** deployable Hermes config lives in [`docs/hermes/`](hermes/)
> (`SOUL.md`, `config.yaml.example`, `.env.example`).

## 1. What Hermes actually is (correcting the scaffold)

The scaffolded code (`backend/adapters/messaging/hermes-whatsapp-gateway.ts`) treats Hermes as
*"POST a WhatsApp template to `https://hermes.example.com/api/whatsapp/send`"*. **It is not a
WhatsApp send API.**

**Hermes Agent** (Nous Research, `hermes-agent.nousresearch.com`, MIT, self-hosted) is a full
**agent gateway process**. It:

- **Owns the WhatsApp connection** natively (also Telegram/Discord/Slack/Signal/Email/CLI) — one
  gateway process, one memory across every surface.
- **Is the brain** — runs a model (OpenAI / Nous Portal / custom), reasons, and calls tools.
- Ships 40–60+ built-in tools, **MCP server integration** (`mcp-<server>` dynamic toolsets),
  a skills system (agentskills.io), cron scheduling, and a `hermes webhook` trigger.
- Is **self-hosted** — and for us it already runs on an **Azure VM**.

So Hermes is not something Pulso *calls to send a message*. Hermes is a peer service that
*talks to users on WhatsApp on Pulso's behalf* and *reads Pulso's data through tools we expose*.

## 2. Architecture

```
                    Azure VM  —  hermes gateway (systemd service)
                    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  WhatsApp   ◄─────►│  Hermes Agent                                 │
  (user phone)      │    • SOUL.md   → personality / system prompt  │
                    │    • model     → OpenAI (gpt-5.6-*)           │
                    │    • toolset   → mcp-pulso ──────────┐        │
                    │    • webhook   → "pulso-alerts"       │        │
                    └───────────────────────────────────────┼────────┘
                                  ▲                          │ MCP (HTTP/SSE)
              (proactive) hermes  │ webhook POST             ▼
                    ┌─────────────┴──────────┐   ┌────────────────────────────┐

                    │  proximity-dispatcher  │   │  (wraps @pulso/core)        │
                    │  (incident insert /SOS)│   │   get_nearby_incidents      │
                    └────────────┬───────────┘   │   get_incident_details      │
                                 │               │   confirm_incident          │
                                 ▼               └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                          Postgres + PostGIS  ◄─────────────────┘
                          (incidents, alert_rules, emergency_contacts…)
```

Two independent flows, both through one Hermes instance:

- **Inbound (conversational)** — §5. The new subsystem this design adds.
- **Outbound (proactive alerts)** — §6. Reworks the existing `proximity-dispatcher`.

### Tool bridge — where the MCP server lives (decided: on the VM, backend frozen)

The MCP server is **not** a new Supabase edge function — it is a small **local stdio MCP shim on
the Azure VM** (`~/.hermes/pulso_mcp.py`, registered under `mcp_servers.pulso`). Per WhatsApp turn
it:

1. reads the sender's E.164 number (§7),
2. service-role lookup `phone → whatsapp_config.phone_e164 → user_id`,
3. mints a short-lived `authenticated` Supabase JWT for that `user_id` (signed with
   `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, held on the VM),
4. forwards the `tools/call` to the **existing, unchanged** `agent-tools` edge function with that
   Bearer — so RLS resolves `auth.uid()` correctly and all three tools run as the real user.

Net effect: **zero new backend code** — the shim + secrets live entirely on the VM you already
run; `agent-tools` and `@pulso/core` are reused as-is. *(Rejected: a new `pulso-mcp` edge function
— grows the backend; a non-MCP VM skill — less idiomatic, loses the clean tool boundary.)*

## 3. Deployment (Azure VM)

Hermes already runs on the VM. Target state:

```bash
hermes setup                       # base config (or `hermes config migrate`)
hermes whatsapp                    # QR-link the Pulso WhatsApp number (§4)
hermes config edit                 # apply docs/hermes/config.yaml.example
#   ~/.hermes/.env      ← docs/hermes/.env.example
#   ~/.hermes/SOUL.md   ← docs/hermes/SOUL.md
hermes config check && hermes doctor
hermes gateway install --system    # run at boot as a systemd service
hermes gateway start
```

All Hermes state lives in `~/.hermes/` on the VM: `config.yaml`, `.env`, `SOUL.md`, `auth.json`,
`skills/`, `sessions/`, `platforms/whatsapp/session`.

## 4. WhatsApp connection — Baileys (QR) for the demo

Hermes offers two WhatsApp methods:

| Method | How | Business-initiated msgs | Setup cost | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **WhatsApp Web / Baileys** | QR-link a normal number (`hermes whatsapp`) | **Free-form, no template approval** | Minutes | ✅ **Demo** |
| WhatsApp Business Cloud API | Meta app + phone number ID | Only **pre-approved templates**, 24 h session window | Days (Meta review) | Production |

**For the hackathon, use Baileys.** It sidesteps Meta's template-approval process entirely — the
proximity/SOS alerts (which are business-*initiated*) can be sent as plain text, which the Cloud
API would forbid without approved templates. This is why the old `WHATSAPP_*_TEMPLATE` env vars
become **unnecessary** for the demo path.

> ⚠️ Baileys is unofficial → ban risk + periodic re-pairing. Fine for a demo on a burner number;
> the doc notes Cloud API as the production migration. Sessions in
> `~/.hermes/platforms/whatsapp/session` are credentials — protect them.

`.env`: `WHATSAPP_ENABLED=true`, `WHATSAPP_MODE=bot`, `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS=<demo numbers>`
(use the specific demo phones during judging; `*` opens it to everyone).

## 5. Inbound conversational flow (the new subsystem)

**User → Hermes → Pulso tools → reply.** No webhook *we* build — Hermes owns the transport.

1. A user messages the Pulso WhatsApp number (e.g. *"¿qué está pasando cerca de la PUCE?"*).
2. Hermes gateway routes it to the agent (SOUL.md persona + OpenAI model).
3. The agent decides to call `get_nearby_incidents` / `get_incident_details` / `confirm_incident`
   from the **`mcp-pulso`** toolset.
4. The MCP server executes the matching `@pulso/core` use-case against Postgres and returns rows.
5. The agent phrases a short Spanish reply; Hermes sends it back on WhatsApp.

The three tools already exist for the "Cerca" voice agent (`REALTIME_TOOLS` +
`backend/supabase/functions/agent-tools`), so **no new tool functions are needed** — "ask about
this incident" and "ask about other cases" are both covered. We only add the MCP transport.

## 6. Outbound proactive alerts (rework of the existing path)

`proximity-dispatcher` no longer POSTs a WhatsApp template. It **triggers Hermes** via
`hermes webhook`:

1. `hermes webhook subscribe "pulso-alerts"` runs on the VM, exposing a URL.
2. On incident insert (DB webhook) or SOS, `proximity-dispatcher` resolves the recipient
   contacts (unchanged: `get_alert_matches` / accepted `emergency_contacts`) and **POSTs one
   payload per recipient** to the `pulso-alerts` webhook: `{ to, kind, incident, distance }`.
3. Hermes delivers to WhatsApp. Two modes:
   - **SOS** → `--deliver-only` (deterministic, no LLM): *"🆘 <name> activó un SOS cerca de ti…"*.
   - **Proximity** → let the agent phrase it warmly, or `--deliver-only` for speed/cost.

**Port/adapter impact:** the `MessagingGateway` port stays. `HermesWhatsAppGateway.sendWhatsApp`
is re-implemented to POST to the Hermes webhook URL (env `HERMES_WEBHOOK_URL` + a shared secret)
instead of a fictional `/whatsapp/send`. `template`/`params` give way to a `{ kind, text|context }`
payload. `WHATSAPP_PROXIMITY_TEMPLATE` / `WHATSAPP_SOS_TEMPLATE` / `WHATSAPP_OPTIN_TEMPLATE` are
retired for the Baileys demo path.

## 7. Security & consent (must-haves before this is public)

- **CRITICAL — allowlist tools per platform.** Hermes ships shell/terminal, web, browser, and
  image-gen tools. A public WhatsApp bot with shell access is a remote-code-execution hole.
  Hermes controls tools **inclusively** via `platform_toolsets` (verified against the repo — there
  is no `disabled_toolsets` in `cli-config.yaml.example`): assign WhatsApp **only** `mcp-pulso`, so
  no dangerous toolset is ever reachable from a chat. Also pin `terminal.backend: docker` as
  defence-in-depth.
- **Identity by phone match (authenticates the user).** The WhatsApp sender number is
  asserted by the transport — it is *not* self-reported. The shim maps
  `sender_e164 → whatsapp_config.phone_e164 → user_id` with the service role, mints a short-lived
  JWT for that matched Pulso account, and runs every tool as that user. **Unmatched senders cannot
  invoke any Pulso tool.** `get_nearby_incidents` also requires explicit `user_lat` and
  `user_long`; Hermes must never invent a location or substitute venue coordinates.
  **Remaining dependency (test on the VM):** whether an MCP `tools/call` carries the WhatsApp
  sender context. If yes → automatic + strict. If no → surface the sender in the agent context
  (system prompt `remitente: +593…`) and pass it as a tool arg (works, model-mediated).
  **Honest limit** (per ADR-017): trust assumes the registered number belongs to the app user;
  the mis-registration edge case is why production wants OTP at registration.
- **Consent / anti-abuse.** Honour the existing opt-in model (ADR-017): only `accepted`
  emergency contacts receive proactive alerts; respect "BAJA" to opt out; `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS`
  gates who the bot even talks to during the demo.
- **Emergencies.** SOUL.md instructs the agent to redirect real emergencies to **ECU 911** — it
  is an information assistant, not a first responder.

## 8. Config reference (everything on Hermes)

See the deployable files in [`docs/hermes/`](hermes/). Summary:

| File (`~/.hermes/`) | Purpose | Key entries |
|---|---|---|
| `.env` | secrets | `WHATSAPP_ENABLED`, `WHATSAPP_MODE`, `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AGENT_TOOLS_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| `config.yaml` | behaviour | `model:` (OpenAI), `platforms.whatsapp`, `mcp_servers.pulso` (→ toolset `mcp-pulso`), `platform_toolsets.whatsapp: [mcp-pulso]` (allowlist), `terminal.backend: docker` |
| `SOUL.md` | personality | agent identity, tone, tool rules, safety (§9) |
| `auth.json` | OAuth | only if Nous Portal is used for the model |

Pulso side (repo `.env` / Supabase secrets), replacing the old `HERMES_*` send vars:

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `HERMES_WEBHOOK_URL` | the `pulso-alerts` webhook the dispatcher POSTs to |
| `HERMES_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | shared secret to authenticate the POST |
| `PROXIMITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | shared secret authenticating the database webhook that invokes `proximity-dispatcher` |
| *(no new tool endpoint)* | tools reuse `agent-tools` unchanged; the VM shim holds `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` to mint per-user JWTs — backend frozen |

## 9. Agent personality

Full text: [`docs/hermes/SOUL.md`](hermes/SOUL.md) (deploy to `~/.hermes/SOUL.md`; it occupies
system-prompt slot #1). It reuses the **"Cerca"** identity from the in-app voice agent
(`create-realtime-session/personas.ts`) so users meet **one** assistant across voice and WhatsApp
— which also showcases Hermes' single-memory-across-surfaces story. Written in Ecuadorian Spanish
(matching the product locale and the existing persona), it defines: identity, objective, tone,
tool-use rules, incident-status semantics, WhatsApp formatting limits, privacy, and emergency
redirection.

## 10. Implemented Pulso repository changes

The Hermes integration now includes these repository changes:

1. **VM-side:** `docs/hermes/pulso_mcp.py` — a stdio MCP shim that phone-matches
   the sender, mints an `authenticated` JWT, and forwards `tools/call` to the **existing**
   `agent-tools` edge function. No new Supabase edge function; the backend stays frozen.
2. **Adapter:** `HermesWhatsAppGateway` POSTs to `HERMES_WEBHOOK_URL` with HMAC V2 signing.
3. **Dispatcher:** `proximity-dispatcher` sends `{ to, kind, context }` per recipient; templates are retired.
4. **Environment:** `_shared/env.ts` + repo `.env.example` use `HERMES_WEBHOOK_URL`,
   `HERMES_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and `PROXIMITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
5. **Decision:** ADR-017 reflects Hermes-as-agent; WhatsApp remains a P1/P2 cuttable layer.

## 11. Rubric fit

- **Uso de OpenAI (25):** the Hermes agent's model is OpenAI (`gpt-5.6-*`), joining the vision
  (`analyze-report`) and Realtime ("Cerca") uses — OpenAI now powers report structuring, the voice
  agent, **and** the WhatsApp agent.
- **Producto funcional (30) / Impacto (10):** a citizen with no app installed can ask about
  nearby incidents and receive safety alerts entirely over WhatsApp — directly serving ODS 11
  (safe, resilient cities) and ODS 13 (risk response) for Manabí.
- **Ejecución técnica (20):** the hexagonal seam holds — Hermes slots behind the existing
  `MessagingGateway` port; the tool layer is reused, not rebuilt.

## 12. Post-demo implementation log (2026-07-21)

Implemented after the Buildathon presentation, during the improvement phase. Each entry
records what was built, why, and what to revisit on migration.

### 12.1 Demo mode in the MCP shim (`PULSO_DEMO_MODE=1`)
Reads (`get_nearby_incidents`, `get_incident_details`) call the PostGIS RPCs directly with
the service role around the venue center (`PULSO_DEFAULT_LAT/LNG`, Portoviejo centro).
**Why:** at demo time the WhatsApp sender never reached the tools and
`whatsapp_config`/`alert_rules` were unseeded. **Migration:** once real users register and
the sender hooks (12.4) are live, set `PULSO_DEMO_MODE=0` to restore the per-user path
(`agent-tools` + minted JWT + personal alert zone).

### 12.2 Community comments read directly (not via RPC)
The shim reads `public.incident_comments` through PostgREST with the service role,
selecting only anonymous fields (`id, body, created_at, author:profiles(verified)`).
**Why:** `get_incident_comments` gates reads on `auth.uid() is not null`; the shim has no
end-user JWT. The RPC remains the correct path for the app. **Note:** this bypasses the
RPC's resolved/expired filter — acceptable because the shim only fetches comments for
incidents it just surfaced.

### 12.3 Incident-detail enrichment
`get_incident_details` returns `{incident, comments}`; `incident` gains `photo_url`
(public `report-photos` bucket URL) and `map_url` (Google Maps link). `SOUL.md` instructs
Cerca to share those links, cite community backing ("3 confirmaron, 1 disputó"), and never
dictate raw coordinates in text.

### 12.4 Sender-identity hooks (core fix)
Hermes upstream never exposes the WhatsApp phone number to the model — the session
context prefers the contact's push-name (upstream issues NousResearch/hermes-agent#35147,
#38978) — so every tool with a `sender` argument received an empty value.
**Fix:** `docs/hermes/hooks/pulso-sender/` (gateway hook on `session:start` +
`agent:start` caches session→`+phone` under `~/.hermes/state/pulso-sender/`) plus
`docs/hermes/agent-hooks/inject-sender.sh` (`pre_llm_call` shell hook injects
`[Remitente WhatsApp verificado por el sistema: +…]` each turn). Registered via the
`hooks:` block + `hooks_auto_accept: true` in `config.yaml`; requires `jq` on the VM.
**Migration:** delete both hooks when (a) Hermes ships native sender exposure (track
#35147) or (b) WhatsApp moves to the Cloud API webhook, which carries the sender natively.

### 12.5 `opt_out` tool — "BAJA" honored (issue #23)
New shim tool `opt_out(sender)`: disables `whatsapp_config.enabled` and declines
`emergency_contacts` invitations — pending AND accepted, since an accepted contact saying
BAJA must also stop receiving SOS. Returns `{disabled, declined_invitations}` so Cerca
confirms truthfully.

### 12.6 VM configuration notes (operational)
- `mcp_servers.pulso.command` must point at the venv python
  `/home/azureuser/.hermes/mcp-venv/bin/python` (has `mcp[cli]` + `pyjwt`).
- The webhook platform is enabled via config.yaml `platforms.webhook.enabled: true`
  (a `.env`-only `WEBHOOK_ENABLED` is not reliably picked up by `hermes gateway restart`).
- `display.platforms.whatsapp.tool_progress: "log"` hides the "⌇ tool…" bubbles in chat
  and audits every call to `~/.hermes/logs/tool_calls.log`.
- Deploy recipe: scp `docs/hermes/{SOUL.md,pulso_mcp.py}`, `docs/hermes/hooks/`,
  `docs/hermes/agent-hooks/` into `~/.hermes/…`, `sudo apt install -y jq`,
  `hermes gateway restart`.

### 12.7 In flight
Issue #22 (place-based geocoding via Nominatim for `get_nearby_incidents`), issue #24
(`accept_invitation` — unblocks SOS delivery to contacts), and the incidents-INSERT
Database Webhook wiring (ops, Dashboard).

### 12.8 Proximity alerts verified end-to-end (2026-07-23)
The full automatic pipeline works: incident INSERT → Database Webhook (Dashboard,
`public.incidents` INSERT → `proximity-dispatcher` edge fn) → `get_alert_matches` →
Hermes webhook → WhatsApp. Key gotcha for anyone reproducing or migrating:
`get_alert_matches` (migration `0002`, frozen) INNER JOINs `emergency_contacts` with
`opt_in_status = 'accepted'` and sends the alert to the **contact's** phone, not the
rule owner's. To receive alerts on your own WhatsApp you must exist as your own
accepted emergency contact (`owner_id` = you, `phone_e164` = your number).

### 12.9 Per-category TTL + incident history (issues #27/#28)
- Migration `0009`: `BEFORE INSERT` trigger derives `expires_at` from category
  (accident/fire 6 h, flood/other 12 h, road_closure 24 h, public_event 8 h). The legacy
  24 h column default was dropped so the trigger sees `NULL`; explicit values win.
- Migration `0010`: `get_incident_history(lat, long, radius, since_hours)` — resolved or
  expired incidents, newest first, max 100 rows, no exact coordinates (only
  `distance_meters`). Granted to `authenticated` + `service_role`.
- Shim tool `get_incident_history` mirrors `get_nearby_incidents` (place geocoding,
  `queried_around` honesty, honest failure on unresolvable place) but calls the RPC
  directly via the service role in BOTH modes: the frozen `agent-tools` edge fn does not
  know this RPC, and the RPC is anonymous and bounded by design. `queried_around.source`
  reports `alert_center` when the user's registered center was used.

**Addendum 12.4 (2026-07-23) — LID aliases:** modern WhatsApp accounts reach the gateway
as a privacy alias (`<lid>@lid`), not the phone JID, so the raw `user_id` cannot be used
for identity. The gateway hook now resolves the alias through Baileys' on-disk mapping
(`~/.hermes/whatsapp/session/lid-mapping-<lid>_reverse.json`; the linked account's own
pair also lives in `creds.json` under `me.id`/`me.lid`). Additionally, the shim matches
`phone_e164` stored with or without the leading `+` (or-filter) so registration format
differences can never break identity resolution.
